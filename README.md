# Matlab toolbox for hydraulic fracturing in transversely isotropic porous media

This toolbox has following features
-  Energy based arc length control for mechanical solver
-  Fully coupled fluid flow within matrix and along fracture with mechanical deformation
-  Multiscale fracture propagation by coupling nonlocal damage with ppr cohesive zone model

Detailed description is documented in the following paper:
